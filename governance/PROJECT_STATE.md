# Project State

Single-page snapshot of where the repository stands. This file is expected to change frequently; it is a snapshot, not a historical record (for that, see `governance/DECISIONS.md` and `governance/DECISION_LOG.md`).

## Current Phase

**Phase 2 — Historical Research**, status `active` (per `governance/RESEARCH_SCOPE.md`). Phase 1 (Foundation) is complete. `HIS-001` is complete on the Work Board. `HIS-002` (Electricity, Grid Infrastructure, and Industrial Electrification) has cleared Gate 1, Single-Cycle Pattern Validation, Stage A/B/C, and Gate 2; its historical synthesis `REV-HIST-002` is **drafted and submitted for Gate 3 (Historical Stability Review)**. Phase 3 (Investment Thesis Engine) remains locked; its entry gates are not yet satisfied (see Roadmap).

## Current Sprint

**Sprint 1 — HIS-002 Cross-Cycle Pattern Validation.** Gate 1 **CONFIRMED PASSED**; Single-Cycle Pattern Validation (HIS-001) **PASSED** (DEC-013); Stage A (Codex), Stage B Source Verification, Source Verification Review, and Stage C Evidence Ledger done; Gate 2 Evidence Sufficiency Review **PASSED** (DEC-015 → DEC-016). **The `REV-HIST-002` historical synthesis is drafted (structure A–I, every conclusion cites an `E-###` claim, citation integrity checked) and Gate 3 returned PASS WITH MINOR REVISIONS (2026-07-22).** The two required calibrations are applied (1937 downgraded to post-window sensitivity; §I PAT-001 holding-company causal implication removed) and the amended synthesis is **resubmitted for Gate 3 confirmation**. It carries the three fixed boundaries (PAT-001 coexisting-divergence-only; PAT-002 US-1920s-overbuild-not-supported; PAT-003 index-dispersion-beta-absorbed / security-level Undecidable-pending-access). No Pattern verdict is set; the Cross-Cycle Comparison / Pattern Validation Matrix HIS-002 verdicts begin only after Gate 3 is confirmed; no Pattern promoted.

## Gate Status

| Gate | Scope | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Gate 1 | Research Design Review — `HIS-001` execution plan | PASS WITH CONDITIONS (12 revisions applied, confirmed passed) |
| Gate 2 | Evidence Sufficiency — `HIS-001` Evidence Ledger | PASS WITH CONDITIONS |
| Gate 3 | Historical Stability — `REV-HIST-001` | PASSED (stable historical asset), 4 minor revisions applied |
| Pattern Review | Candidate Patterns `PAT-001`–`PAT-003` | PASS WITH MINOR REVISIONS — both authorized revisions confirmed complete: `PAT-001`'s Pattern Statement wording (commit `d0b7910`) and `PAT-002`'s operational definition of overbuild (already present in its Mechanism section — authorization→subscription→called→paid→expenditure→completed→impaired, kept strictly distinct; verified and recorded complete in Sprint 0.1, no file change needed) |
| Pattern Validation Framework methodology review | `governance/PATTERN_VALIDATION_FRAMEWORK.md` | Internal-completeness gap closed (Undecidable handling added to §3); assessed ready for review. Formal Research Architect sign-off not yet separately confirmed — see `governance/HIS-002_RESEARCH_BRIEF.md` §11. |
| Gate 1 | Research Design Review — `HIS-002` brief | **CONFIRMED PASSED** (DEC-012; 8 revisions verified; original escalation conditions restored) |
| Single-Cycle Pattern Validation (HIS-001) | Originating-cycle validation gate introduced by DEC-012 §11.2 | **PASSED** (DEC-013). PAT-001/PAT-002 remain `draft` (scope narrowed / load-bearing gap); PAT-003 → `validated-in-one-cycle`. See `governance/HIS-001_SINGLE_CYCLE_PATTERN_VALIDATION.md` (`id: HIS-001-SCPV`) |
| Stage A | HIS-002 Source Orientation | PASSED WITH STAGE B CONDITIONS (Codex authored the 20-source register) |
| Stage B | HIS-002 Source Acquisition & Verification | **PASSED** (Source Verification Review). Readiness package in `HIS-002_SOURCE_REGISTER.md`. |
| Source Verification Review | HIS-002 Stage B readiness | **Stage B PASSED; Stage C AUTHORIZED** ((b)+parallel access-escalation path; bounded escalation limited to S-012/S-011/S-005). |
| Stage C | HIS-002 Evidence Ledger | **Complete.** `HIS-002_EVIDENCE_LEDGER.md`, 58 `E-###` claims, four lanes/Pattern, open-source scope; security-level PAT-003 recorded Undecidable-pending-access. |
| Gate 2 | HIS-002 Evidence Sufficiency Review | **PASS** (PASS WITH CONDITIONS → PASS; six ledger corrections applied). `REV-HIST-002` synthesis authorized with three fixed boundaries. See `governance/HIS-002_GATE_2_REVIEW.md` (`id: HIS-002-GATE-2`). |
| Gate 3 | HIS-002 Historical Stability — `REV-HIST-002` | **PASS WITH MINOR REVISIONS** (2026-07-22); the two required calibrations are applied (1937 → post-window sensitivity; §I PAT-001 holding-company causal implication removed) and the amended synthesis is resubmitted for **Gate 3 confirmation**. |

## Stable Assets

- `governance/PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md`, `RESEARCH_SCOPE.md`, `OPERATING_PRINCIPLES.md`, `NAMING_AND_IDS.md`, `FRONTMATTER_STANDARD.md`, `AGENTS.md` — Phase 1 foundation.
- `knowledge/industrial-revolutions/REV-HIST-001_STEAM_AND_RAILWAYS.md` — historical synthesis, Gate 3 PASSED.
- `governance/HIS-001_GATE_1_REVIEW.md` (`id: HIS-001-GATE-1`) — closed review record.

## ID Note (Sprint 0.1, applied prospectively in Sprint 1)

`HIS-001` is the task ID only. The brief, plan, and Gate 1 review each carry their own unique ID: `HIS-001-BRIEF`, `HIS-001-PLAN`, `HIS-001-GATE-1` — consistent with `HIS-001-SOURCE-REGISTER` and `HIS-001-EVIDENCE-LEDGER`. `HIS-002_RESEARCH_BRIEF.md` was drafted directly with `id: HIS-002-BRIEF` from the start, applying this convention prospectively rather than repeating the original `HIS-001` naming issue.

## Draft Assets

- `knowledge/industrial-revolutions/HIS-001_RESEARCH_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`, `HIS-001_SOURCE_REGISTER.md`, `HIS-001_EVIDENCE_LEDGER.md` — inputs feeding a now-stable synthesis; retained at `draft` because they are working documents, not the reviewed output.
- `patterns/PAT-001_SOCIAL_VALUE_INVESTOR_RETURN_DIVERGENCE.md` — `status: draft`; core narrowed to two-ledger divergence, operating-profit demoted to supporting sub-mechanism (DEC-013).
- `patterns/PAT-002_CAPITAL_CYCLE_OVERBUILD.md` — `status: draft`; financing-side impairment supported, physical-overbuild leg a load-bearing gap; falsification condition added (DEC-013).
- `patterns/PAT-003_ENTRY_TIMING_AND_FINANCING_STRUCTURE.md` — **`status: validated-in-one-cycle`** (DEC-013); cohort/index-level, bounded; falsification statement added. Not `active`; does not count toward the Phase 3 gate.
- `governance/HIS-002_RESEARCH_BRIEF.md` (`id: HIS-002-BRIEF`) — research design; 8 Gate 1 revisions applied; §12 Resolved Decisions records the three §11 rulings (DEC-012). No evidence collected.
- `governance/HIS-002_GATE_1_REVIEW.md` (`id: HIS-002-GATE-1`) — Gate 1 review record; verdict PASS WITH CONDITIONS, re-review pending.
- `knowledge/industrial-revolutions/HIS-002_RESEARCH_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` (`id: HIS-002-PLAN`) — authored and internally checked against the approved brief; implements brief §8.4 (parallel four-outcome searches per Pattern). No evidence collected.
- `knowledge/industrial-revolutions/HIS-002_SOURCE_REGISTER.md` (`id: HIS-002-SOURCE-REGISTER`) — Stage A candidate landscape (Codex) **plus the Stage B verified-source readiness package** (claude-code): every Tier 1 source verified against the actual object; 5 bibliographic corrections; FTC S-005 index-first acquisition map. No Evidence Ledger.
- `knowledge/industrial-revolutions/HIS-002_EVIDENCE_LEDGER.md` (`id: HIS-002-EVIDENCE-LEDGER`) — Stage C deliverable; 58 `E-###` claims across four lanes for all three Patterns, open-source scope; Evidence Sufficiency Review conditions applied (E-117/E-118 added; E-109/E-211/E-301–E-310 reclassified). Gate 2 PASSED.
- `governance/HIS-002_GATE_2_REVIEW.md` (`id: HIS-002-GATE-2`) — Evidence Sufficiency Review record; verdict PASS; three fixed synthesis boundaries.
- `knowledge/industrial-revolutions/REV-HIST-002_ELECTRICITY_GRID_AND_INDUSTRIAL_ELECTRIFICATION.md` (`id: REV-HIST-002`) — HIS-002 historical synthesis; drafted from the Evidence Ledger (structure A–I, every conclusion cites an `E-###` claim), carries the three fixed boundaries; sets no Pattern verdict. **Submitted for Gate 3 (Historical Stability); no verdict yet.**
- `patterns/PATTERN_VALIDATION_MATRIX.md` — tracking asset; HIS-001 column records the DEC-013 dispositions; HIS-002/HIS-003 columns **pending** (unchanged — HIS-002 verdicts are set only after Gate 3).

## Stable / Active Governance Records (this sprint)

- `governance/HIS-001_SINGLE_CYCLE_PATTERN_VALIDATION.md` (`id: HIS-001-SCPV`) — the Single-Cycle Pattern Validation Gate record (PASSED, DEC-013).

## Blocked Work

- **Historical-to-AI Mapping** — blocked. The prior authorization for `MAP-001_RAILWAY_MANIA_AND_AI_INFRASTRUCTURE.md` was withdrawn before any file was created. Mapping work does not resume until a Pattern reaches `cross-cycle-candidate` or better under the Pattern Validation Framework.
- **`HIS-002` Gate 3 (Historical Stability)** — **PASS WITH MINOR REVISIONS; awaiting confirmation** (Research Architect). The two calibrations are applied to `REV-HIST-002`; the amended synthesis is resubmitted. The Cross-Cycle Comparison / Pattern Validation Matrix HIS-002 verdicts are blocked behind Gate 3 confirmation.
- **PAT-003 security-level module** — Undecidable-pending-access, blocked on the recommended bounded access escalation (Moody's PU manuals S-012 + Taylor 1962 S-011 + a browser HathiTrust session for FTC S-005).
- **`HIS-003`** — blocked, not started.
- **Investment Thesis (`THS-001`)** — blocked. Phase 3 entry gates unmet (see Roadmap).

## Active Task

Sprint 1 — HIS-002 **Gate 3 confirmation of the amended `REV-HIST-002`** — awaiting the Research Architect. Gate 3 returned PASS WITH MINOR REVISIONS (2026-07-22); the two required calibrations are applied (1937 → post-window sensitivity; §I PAT-001 holding-company causal implication removed) and the synthesis is resubmitted. Only after Gate 3 is confirmed does the Cross-Cycle Comparison / Pattern Validation Matrix HIS-002 verdict-setting begin. No Matrix verdict update or Pattern promotion until then.

## Known Evidence Gaps

Carried from Stage B/C of `HIS-001`, unresolved and not addressed by this sprint:

- York and North Midland Railway cash-flow reconstruction: `undecidable` (C-166) — no dated call schedule was located.
- Provincial-market coverage question: partially resolved, not fully closed.
- `MAP-001`'s structural specification was requested but never supplied before its authorization was withdrawn. Not currently needed — Mapping work is paused.

**Gate 3 — Historical Stability Review** of the forthcoming `REV-HIST-002` synthesis (Research Architect), after Claude Code drafts it. The bounded access escalation recommended at Stage B (Moody's PU manuals S-012 + Taylor 1962 S-011 + a browser HathiTrust session for FTC S-005) remains open and would unblock the PAT-003 security-level module. Formal confirmation of the Pattern Validation Framework methodology review remains separately outstanding but does not alter the already-recorded DEC-012/DEC-013 execution sequence.
